# Creepy Kanye

A clojure app to recognize faces from a webcam.

## Installation

JavaCV is a monstrous beast and a massive pain in the ass to install. Install
the dependencies with `babushka`

    $ sh -c "`curl https://babushka.me/up`" #install babushka
    $ babushka creepykanye #... wait to finish

This is only working for OSX at the moment.
